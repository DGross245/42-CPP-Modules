# CPP Module 02

Welcome to Module 02 of the CPP Modules! This module serves as an introduction to C++ programming language basics.

## Topics Covered
- Ad-hoc polymorphism
- operator overloading
- Orthodox Canonical class form

## Exercises
- **Exercise 00: My First Class in Orthodox Canonical Form**
  - Description: The program implements a class called Fixed representing fixed-point numbers in C++.
  - Usage:
    ```bash
    cd ex00
    make
    ./Fixed
    ```

- **Exercise 01: Towards a more useful fixed-point number class**
  - Description: Enhances the Fixed class to support initialization with integers or floats, conversion to float or integer, and overloads the insertion operator for printing fixed-point numbers
  - Usage:
    ```bash
    cd ex01
    make
    ./Fixed
    ```

- **Exercise 02: Now weâ€™re talking**
  - Description: Expands the Fixed class with overloaded operators for comparison, arithmetic, and increment/decrement, as well as static member functions for finding the minimum and maximum fixed-point numbers
  - Usage:
    ```bash
    cd ex02
    make
    ./Fixed
    ```
