# CPP Module 06

Welcome to Module 06 of the CPP Modules! This module serves as an introduction to C++ programming language basics.

## Topics Covered
- C++ casts

## Exercises
- **Exercise 00: Conversion of scalar types**
  - Description: This program takes an input (char, int, float, double) and automatically detects its type converting it to it. It then converts the input to each of the other types and prints the converted values if they are printable in the new type.
  - Usage:
    ```bash
    cd ex00
    make
    ./convert [input]
    ```

- **Exercise 01: Serialization**
  - Description: This program demonstrates the serialization and deserialization process of a string, showcasing that the result is the same pointer as the original string.
  - Usage:
    ```bash
    cd ex01
    make
    ./Serializer
    ```

- **Exercise 02: Identify real type**
  - Description: Implements classes with a base and three derived classes. It includes functions to generate random instances and identify their types without using typeinfo.
  - Usage:
    ```bash
    cd ex02
    make
    ./Base
    ```
