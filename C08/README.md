# CPP Module 08

Welcome to Module 08 of the CPP Modules! This module serves as an introduction to C++ programming language basics.

## Topics Covered
- Templated containers
- iterators
- algorithms

## Exercises
- **Exercise 00: Easy find**
  - Description: The function template easyfind takes a container of type T and an integer searchValue. It finds the first occurrence of searchValue in container and returns its index if found, otherwise, it returns -1.
  - Usage:
    ```bash
    cd ex00
    make
    ./easyfind
    ```

- **Exercise 01: Span**
  - Description: The Span class stores a maximum of N integers and provides functions to add a single number, calculate the shortest span, and the longest span between all stored numbers. It also supports adding multiple numbers at once using iterators.
    ```bash
    cd ex01
    make
    ./Span
    ```

- **Exercise 02: Mutated abomination**
  - Description: The MutantStack class extends the functionality of std::stack by adding iterators.
    ```bash
    cd ex02
    make
    ./MutantStack
    ```
